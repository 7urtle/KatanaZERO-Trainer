# KatanaZERO-Trainer
It works for latest version of Katana ZERO game, with 4 functions, typein corresponding number again to disable function.
1. Unlimittime - which gives you unlimittime in levels
2. Enemy can't hit you  -  You could still be killed by lasers.
3. No clip - Disable collisons to walls, You might fall into void with this.
4. Disable Enemy AI - As it says it disables all enemies' AI.

It's a simple project for me to learn basic reverse engineering and RPM/WPM. I hope it will be helpful to someone.
Basic hack logic from [GreenHouse's Table](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=9248)  
GHN's code for searching memory helps a lot too.
